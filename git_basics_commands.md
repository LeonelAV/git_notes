# Git basics 
## Init a repository

To initialize a repository we have to use the command `git init`
After this command will create a hidden `.git` sub-folder in the project folder

## Track first changes

First our files are *untracked*
To start tracking our files we have to `commit` them


For example, if we have as `index.html` created we can start tracking it by doing...

```
git init
git add index.html
git commit -m "first commit"
```
